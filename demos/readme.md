# Building Copilots and Agentic Apps with Microsoft Foundry & Microsoft Agent Framework

This five-day class is crafted for software architects and engineers eager to master the end-to-end process of building, orchestrating, and integrating advanced copilots and agentic applications using Microsoft’s latest frameworks and services.

The class begins by establishing a strong foundation in Copilots, Agents, and the Microsoft Foundry platform. You’ll gain hands-on experience deploying large language models, working with the Foundry SDK, and developing robust agentic solutions through prompt engineering and Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

As we dive deeper, you’ll explore the Foundry Agent Service—a fully managed, scalable environment for hosting agents—learning to connect knowledge sources, automate workflows, and leverage features like contextual knowledge graphs and Work IQ for enterprise-ready deployments.

The journey continues with a focus on orchestration and workflow design, as you work extensively with the Microsoft Agent Framework. Here, you’ll configure agents for complex, multi-modal scenarios, implement persistent memory, and design sophisticated orchestration patterns with advanced observability and governance. Conversation management, middleware integration, and security are emphasized throughout, ensuring your solutions are both powerful and maintainable.

As the class progresses, you’ll move into pro-code extensibility, building both declarative and custom agents, and preparing your solutions for seamless integration into Copilot Chat, Teams, or the channel of your choice. Everything comes together with the Microsoft Agents SDK, enabling you to connect Copilot Studio and Foundry agents, orchestrate multi-agent solutions, and publish intelligent agents across the Microsoft ecosystem.

Throughout, hands-on labs and demos in Python and C# ensure practical experience at every step. By the end, you’ll be ready to implement, orchestrate, and integrate intelligent pro-code agents—empowering you to deliver scalable, enterprise-grade AI solutions with deep integration into the Microsoft Copilot ecosystem
