# Implementing Agents and Copilots using Semantic Kernel and Azure AI Agent Service

This in-depth course that takes developers from foundational concepts to advanced multi-agent orchestration using Microsoft's AI ecosystem. The course begins with Azure AI Foundry essentials, covering hubs, projects, and resources while establishing expertise in prompt engineering, GitHub Models, and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol fundamentals. Students dive deep into Semantic Kernel development, mastering chat completion, multi-modal capabilities, and advanced prompt templating using YAML, Handlebar, and Liquid formats.

The curriculum provides extensive coverage of Semantic Kernel's plugin architecture, including native functions, OpenAPI integrations, and MCP server implementations, alongside Kernel Memory and vector store connectors for RAG solutions. Participants will master both the Semantic Kernel Agent and Process Frameworks, learning to build multi-step task agents with personas while choosing between Orleans and Dapr runtimes. The course emphasizes Azure AI Foundry's multi-agent solutions, teaching students to leverage the Azure AI Agent Service with action tools (code interpreters, function calling) and knowledge tools (file search, Azure AI Search, Bing Grounding).

Advanced topics include orchestrating complex multi-agent solutions, implementing human-in-the-loop patterns, and integrating .NET Aspire for scalable deployments. The final module ensures production readiness through security, monitoring, and evaluation strategies including agent guardrails, risk monitoring, and Azure AI Foundry's governance and observability features. By completion, students will architect and deploy secure, monitored multi-agent systems leveraging the full power of Azure AI Foundry's orchestration capabilities.

Throughout all modules, you'll work with hands-on code samples in both Python and C#, giving you practical experience building production-ready AI agent solutions.
