# Implementing Agents and Copilots using Semantic Kernel and Azure AI Agent Service

This comprehensive development five-days class teaches you how to build intelligent AI agents and copilots using Microsoft's Semantic Kernel framework and Azure AI services.

You'll start with foundational concepts in Azure AI Foundry, learn effective prompt engineering, and understand RAG techniques for data integration.

The core of the class focuses on Semantic Kernel development - from basic concepts through advanced patterns including plugins, memory systems, agent frameworks, and process orchestration. You'll implement multi-agent solutions and learn how to leverage Azure AI Agent Service for sophisticated applications.

The class concludes with practical implementation of Microsoft 365 Copilots through plugins and connectors.

Throughout all modules, you'll work with hands-on code samples in both Python and C#, giving you practical experience building production-ready AI agent solutions.
