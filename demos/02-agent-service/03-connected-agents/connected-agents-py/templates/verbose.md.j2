# {{ ticket_number }} - Verbose Analysis

**Description:** {{ user_prompt }}

**Timestamp:** {{ timestamp }}

## Outcome

The ticket was processed through a multi-agent triage system where specialized agents analyzed different aspects:
- **Priority Agent**: Assessed urgency based on impact and user-facing issues
- **Team Agent**: Determined optimal team assignment based on ticket content
- **Effort Agent**: Estimated required work and complexity

The main orchestrator agent coordinated these assessments to provide comprehensive triage results.

## Technical Process (Verbose)

The triage agent used connected agents as tools. Each specialized agent operates independently with its own instructions, while the main agent delegates tasks and aggregates responses.
