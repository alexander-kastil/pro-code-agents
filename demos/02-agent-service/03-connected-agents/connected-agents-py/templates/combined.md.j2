## Outcome

Your support ticket has been automatically analyzed and categorized. Our AI-powered triage system has:

✅ **Assessed the priority** of your issue to ensure urgent matters get immediate attention  
✅ **Identified the right team** to handle your request based on the technical area  
✅ **Estimated the effort** required so you know what to expect for resolution time  

{% if triage_result %}
**Analysis Result:**

{{ triage_result }}

{% endif %}
The analysis is complete and your ticket has been routed to the appropriate team for action.

## Technical Process

The triage agent used connected agents as tools. Each specialized agent operates independently with its own instructions, while the main agent delegates tasks and aggregates responses.

**System Architecture:**
- **Priority Agent**: Assessed urgency based on impact and user-facing issues
- **Team Agent**: Determined optimal team assignment based on ticket content
- **Effort Agent**: Estimated required work and complexity

The main orchestrator agent coordinated these assessments to provide comprehensive triage results.

**Token Usage:**
- Input Tokens: {{ tokens_in }}
- Output Tokens: {{ tokens_out }}
- Total Tokens: {{ tokens_total }}
