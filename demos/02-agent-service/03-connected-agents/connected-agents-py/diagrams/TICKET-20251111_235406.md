## Technical Process

The triage agent used connected agents as tools. Each specialized agent operates independently with its own instructions, while the main agent delegates tasks and aggregates responses.

**System Architecture:**
- **Priority Agent**: Assessed urgency based on impact and user-facing issues
- **Team Agent**: Determined optimal team assignment based on ticket content
- **Effort Agent**: Estimated required work and complexity

The main orchestrator agent coordinated these assessments to provide comprehensive triage results.

**Token Usage:**
- Input Tokens: 2028
- Output Tokens: 181
- Total Tokens: 2209
