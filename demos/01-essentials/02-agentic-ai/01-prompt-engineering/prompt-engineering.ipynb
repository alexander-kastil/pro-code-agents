    "### What is Prompt Engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing inputs (prompts) to AI language models to elicit desired responses. It's crucial for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Getting precise and relevant answers\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Ensuring reliable outputs across similar queries\n",
    "- **Control**: Directing the model's behavior and output format\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Reducing the need for multiple iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It Matters for Agentic AI\n",
    "\n",
    "In agentic AI systems, prompts serve as the primary interface for:\n",
    "- Defining agent roles and behaviors\n",
    "- Controlling task execution\n",
    "- Managing multi-turn conversations\n",
    "- Coordinating multiple agents\n",
    "\n",

      "1. **Easy to Learn and Use**: Python has a simple syntax similar to English, which makes it accessible to beginners.\n",
      "2. **Interpreted Language**: Python code is executed line-by-line, which makes debugging easier.\n",
      "3. **Dynamic Typing**: Variable types are determined at runtime, allowing for flexible coding.\n",
      "4. **Extensive Standard Library**: Python comes with a large standard library that supports many common programming tasks such as file I/O, system calls, and internet protocols.\n",
      "5. **Cross-Platform**: Python runs on various operating systems including Windows, macOS, Linux, and more.\n",
      "6. **Support for Multiple Programming Paradigms**: Python supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles.\n",
      "7. **Large Ecosystem and Community**: There are numerous third-party libraries and frameworks available for web development (Django, Flask), data analysis (Pandas, NumPy), machine learning (TensorFlow, scikit-learn), automation, and more.\n",

    "### Key Principles of Effective Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Be Specific**: Clearly state what you want, including format, length, and style\n",
    "2. **Provide Context**: Use system messages to set roles and expectations\n",
    "3. **Use Examples**: Few-shot learning dramatically improves consistency\n",
    "4. **Structure Your Prompts**: Use delimiters and clear sections\n",
    "5. **Control Temperature**: Adjust based on your need for creativity vs. consistency\n",
    "6. **Encourage Reasoning**: Use chain of thought for complex tasks\n",
    "7. **Iterate and Refine**: Use conversation history to progressively improve outputs\n",
    "8. **Set Constraints**: Define boundaries for length, format, tone, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Agentic AI\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Define Clear Roles**: Each agent should have a well-defined purpose and expertise\n",
    "- **Use Consistent Formats**: Standardize input/output formats across agents\n",
    "- **Plan for Edge Cases**: Include instructions for handling unexpected inputs\n",
    "- **Monitor and Log**: Track prompt performance and iterate based on results\n",
    "- **Test Systematically**: Validate prompts across diverse scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experiment with different prompt patterns for your use case\n",
    "- Build a library of effective prompts for common tasks\n",
    "- Measure and compare prompt performance quantitatively\n",
    "- Explore advanced techniques like prompt chaining and agent orchestration\n",
