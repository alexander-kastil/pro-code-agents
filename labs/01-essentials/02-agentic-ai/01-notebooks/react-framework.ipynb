    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) framework**, which synergistically combines reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner. ReAct enables AI agents to generate verbal reasoning traces while simultaneously taking actions, creating a powerful paradigm for autonomous problem-solving.\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is ReAct?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ReAct** (Reasoning and Acting) is a framework that combines:\n",
    "- **Reasoning**: Generating thought traces that explain decision-making\n",
    "- **Acting**: Taking actions in the environment using available tools\n",
    "\n",
    "The key innovation is the interleaving of reasoning and action, creating a loop:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Thought → Action → Observation → Thought → Action → ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ReAct vs. Traditional Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "| Approach | Reasoning | Actions | Interleaved |\n",
    "|----------|-----------|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| Chain-of-Thought | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |\n",
    "| Action-Only Agents | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ |\n",
    "| **ReAct** | **✓** | **✓** | **✓** |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of ReAct\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interpretability**: Reasoning traces explain why actions are taken\n",
    "2. **Diagnosability**: Easy to identify where reasoning or execution fails\n",
    "3. **Controllability**: Can guide behavior by modifying reasoning prompts\n",
    "4. **Flexibility**: Adapts to new tools and environments easily\n",
    "5. **Human-like**: Mirrors how humans think and act on problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thought**: Internal reasoning about what to do next\n",
    "2. **Action**: Specific tool or function call with parameters\n",
    "3. **Observation**: Result returned from the action\n",
    "4. **Decision**: Whether to continue or conclude\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example ReAct Trace\n",
    "\n",

    "**Action Parsing:**\n",
    "- Use regex for consistent action extraction\n",
    "- Handle variations in formatting gracefully\n",
    "- Provide clear error messages for invalid actions\n",
    "- Support both quoted and unquoted arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tool Design:**\n",
    "- Keep tools focused and single-purpose\n",
    "- Provide clear, informative descriptions\n",
    "- Return structured, parseable results\n",
    "- Include error handling in every tool\n",
    "- Document expected input formats\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error Handling:**\n",
    "- Let the agent see and reason about errors\n",
    "- Provide actionable error messages\n",
    "- Allow the agent to retry with different approaches\n",
    "- Set iteration limits to prevent infinite loops\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reflection and Self-Correction:**\n",
    "- Prompt for periodic reflection on progress\n",

    "### Comparison with Other Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern | Strengths | Weaknesses | Best For |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|------------|----------|\n",
    "| **ReAct** | Transparent, flexible, robust | More API calls, complex parsing | Multi-step tasks with tools |\n",
    "| Chain-of-Thought | Simple, effective | No actions, less interactive | Pure reasoning tasks |\n",
    "| Function Calling | Native support, reliable | Less transparent reasoning | Single-tool interactions |\n",
    "| Agentic RAG | Knowledge-grounded | Requires good retrieval | Information-intensive tasks |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Latency**: Each iteration adds API latency\n",
    "   - Solution: Parallel tool execution when possible\n",
    "   - Cache frequently used tool results\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cost**: Multiple iterations increase token usage\n",
    "   - Solution: Set reasonable iteration limits\n",
    "   - Use smaller models for simple steps\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reliability**: Parsing can fail on unexpected formats\n",
    "   - Solution: Robust parsing with fallbacks\n",
    "   - Retry with clearer instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Monitoring**: Track agent behavior and success rates\n",
    "   - Log all reasoning traces\n",
    "   - Monitor tool usage patterns\n",
    "   - Measure task completion rates\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Safety**: Agents can take unexpected actions\n",
    "   - Solution: Validate tool inputs\n",
    "   - Implement tool whitelisting\n",
    "   - Add human approval for sensitive actions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-Agent ReAct**: Multiple ReAct agents collaborating\n",
    "2. **Hierarchical ReAct**: Decompose into sub-tasks, each with ReAct\n",
    "3. **ReAct + RAG**: Combine with retrieval for knowledge-grounded actions\n",
    "4. **ReAct + Planning**: Add explicit planning phase before acting\n",
    "5. **Meta-ReAct**: Agent reasons about which reasoning strategy to use\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use ReAct\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good Use Cases:**\n",
    "- Tasks requiring multiple tool calls\n",
    "- Problems needing exploratory approaches\n",
    "- Scenarios where transparency is important\n",
    "- Complex workflows with decision points\n",
    "- Error-prone environments needing recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maybe Not Ideal:**\n",
    "- Simple single-step questions\n",
    "- Ultra-low latency requirements\n",
    "- Pure generation tasks without tools\n",
    "- Highly cost-sensitive applications\n",
